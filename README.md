Check out the demo [here](https://shacon.github.io/thought-bubbles/)

## Development
simulate CDN by running the following command from the `docs` directory 
```bash
 python -m http.server 8001
```
Then open http://localhost:8001/
and also open http://localhost:8001/send.html
and paste the ID from one to the other to send messages back and forth

## Deploy
- This code is meant to be run on a CDN

## Ideas
- add a build step to bundle everything into one line to speed up client downloads
